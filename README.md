## Overview

This is a desktop version website created for my first AI using "tensorflow-models and Coco ssd".

### The challenge

- The main challenge was creating an AI object-detector in react and to demonstrate my skills and experience.

### What I learned

**Dale Cottrell:**

While working on this project I was able to learn about basic AI object-detection using "tensorflow-models and Coco ssd". My most valuable experience was the challenge of building out app that entialed loading and resizing images and settting up the normalization sequence for tensorFlow and coco-ssd to map. This project was a lot of fun and I am anxous to take it much further to learn more about AI programming.
